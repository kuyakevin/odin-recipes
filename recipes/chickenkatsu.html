    <h3>Chicken Katsu is a fast and easy recipe that can be done with breasts, thighs, or even pork cutlets<br>
    For this recipe, we will be using chicken breasts for a single serving.</h3>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless boneless chicken breasts (about 0.5 lbs total)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper (<em>Do not cut corners! Get the real stuff!)</em></li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 eggs whisked</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic powder or granulated garlic</li>
        <li>Vegetable or peanut oil for frying</li>
        <li><strong><em>Optional: </em></strong>1 small cabbage for garnish</li>
        <li><strong><em>Optional, but highly encouraged: </em></strong>3 cups of cooked white rice</li>
    </ul>   

    <h2>Make It</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make white rice.</li>
        <li>Cut each breast in half lengthwise so that you have 4 pieces of breast meat total.</li>
        <li>Add paprika to flour and mix.</li>
        <li>Fill a large skillet or cast iron with up to 1/3 inch of oil. Set the heat to 350 degrees,<br>
            just short of the oil smoking (medium on the knob for those without a thermometer).</li>
        <li>Rub each piece of chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder all around.</li>
        <li>Place the flour, eggs, and panko seperately into 3 shallow bowls.</li>
        <li>Working with one piece at a time, drag the meat in flour. Shake off the extra flour, then <br>
        place into egg wash. Let the egg drip off, then place in panko bowl. Coat both sides with Panko, <br>
        then place into oil.</li>
        <li>Let the katsu fry until golden brown. What I do is wait until the frying starts to die down <br>
        a bit, then flip it over.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, bring katsu immediately to a clean chopping board. Cut the chicken into <br>
        slices that are 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Serve over a bed of rice. Add tonkatsu sauce if desired (recipe below)</li>
    </ol>
